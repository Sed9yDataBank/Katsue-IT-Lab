## General info
For Katsue IT Lab As A startup It is important For Customers To Know That They Can Reach Katsue Easily. Having This Information Online Helps Potential Customers Reach Katsue Offices.
With This Web Application Katsue IT Lab Have The Ability To Promote And Advertise The Startup In An Organic, Professional Manner. 
Katsue IT Lab Is Backed Up With A Functional Admin Panel, This Was Created In Order To Fight Back Struggles Of The Human Resource Department, Who Is Mainly Responsible About Adding, Changing Content In The Website.

We Made A Survery About Which Sections Are The Most Ones Changed Over The Year In The Website, And The Result Is, The Informative Section About Employees In Join Us Page, And The Way HR Manages Recieved Messages From The Contact Form In Home Page.

Before The HR Team Always Needed Assistance From The Tech Departmenet To Change Code Layout When Adding New Things, Which Is Frustrating Specially Styling The New Changes In Order To Not Lose Website Responsivity. Also It Is A Waste Of Time For The Devs Since They Have Other Main Tasks To Do, Specially That Katsue IT Lab Is New Start Up So Every Extra Effort Counts.
