✎ Katsue IT Lab Is Backed Up With A Functional Admin Panel, This Was Created In Order To Fight Back Struggles Of The Human Resource Department, Who Is Mainly Responsible About Adding, Changing Content In The Website.

We Made A Survery About Which Sections Are The Most Ones Changed Over The Year In The Website, And The Result Is, The Informative Section About Employees In Join Us Page, And The Way HR Manages Recieved Messages From The Contact Form In Home Page.

Before The HR Team Always Needed Assistance From The Tech Departmenet To Change Code Layout When Adding New Things, Which Is Frustrating Specially Styling The New Changes In Order To Not Lose Website Responsivity. Also It Is A Waste Of Time For The Devs Since They Have Other Main Tasks To Do, Specially That Katsue IT Lab Is New Start Up So Every Extra Effort Counts.

✎ The Admin Panel Is Not Eligibele For Normal Users, It Contains A Login Page Supported With Authentication Process From Katsue Server.

✎ The Admin Panel Contains ' (2) Main Pages ', Page For Adding New Employee Information In Two Places, In The Admin Panel And In The Join Us Page, The Difference Is That Employee Information Are Supported With API Documentation, A Table Of The DataBase That's Give Choice To Admins To Edit, Delete Information About Employees.
The Second Page Contains A Mail Box Layout, It Fetch Sent Messages Of Users From The DataBase. It Is Also Supported With API Documentation And Choice To Directley Reply On Messages From The MailBox Page Without Enterning Any Mail Service Platforms, Gmail For Example.
